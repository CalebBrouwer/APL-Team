About
========================================================================

This is an edit to the Pokemon Showdown client that only shows data for Pokemon from generations 1, 3, and 5. I made this so that I could easily filter the available Pokemon in APL season 2 through the Showdown Teambuilder.

Usage
========================================================================

* Download & extract
* Open "testclient.html"
* If a pop-up mentioning browser security is shown, click cancel
* Navigate to Teambuilder and create a National Dex format folder
* Create a new team/box and add pokemon and filter as desired
